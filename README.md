# My Defi Platform 

## Overview

This Ethereum project consists of eight separate smart contracts that collectively form a decentralized financial platform. The main storage contract maintains shared variables and acts as a central hub for the interconnected contracts. Each contract serves a specific purpose within the ecosystem.

## Smart Contracts

1. **Main Storage Contract**
   - Maintains shared variables for the interconnected contracts.

2. **Public Saving Book Contract**
   - Incorporates MLM and staking concepts.
   - Rewards users for staking and participation.

3. **Private Saving Book Contract**
   - Facilitates the transfer of ERC20 tokens to the cash flow contract.

4. **Flex Staking Contract**
   - Allows staking without time restrictions.
   - Rewards users based on amounts received from the cash flow contract.

5. **Insurance Contract**
   - Provides real insurance for platform users.
   - Users can purchase insurance within this contract.

6. **Presale Contract**
   - Facilitates presale events for token offerings.

7. **ICO Contract**
   - Manages the initial coin offering (ICO) process.

8. **Cashflow Contract**
   - Centralized contract for fund distribution.
   - Operator distributes funds received to preset contracts and wallet addresses based on allocated ratios.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Contracts are developed in Solidity, ensuring compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **Smart Contract Interactions**: Contracts interact seamlessly for a cohesive financial ecosystem.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Incorporates various DeFi concepts such as staking, insurance, presales, and ICOs.
